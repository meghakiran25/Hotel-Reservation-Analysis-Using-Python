# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-Using-Python
# Objective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze hotel booking cancellations and other factors that do not impact business and yearly revenue generation. This analysis aims to enhance revenue efficiency and provide comprehensive business advice to address these issues.

# Assumptions
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">The information is still current and can be used to analyze a hotel's possible plans in an efficient manner</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">There are no unanticipated negatives to the hotel employing any advised technique.</li>
 </ul>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">The hotels are not currently using any of the suggested solutions.</li> 
</ul>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">The biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellations.</li>
 </ul>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked length of time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">Clients make hotel reservations the same year they make cancellations.</li>
</ul>

# Research Questions
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?</li>
</ul>

# Hypothesis

<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">More cancellations occur when prices are higher.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.</li>
</ul>

 # Insights:
 1. There is a significant number of reservations that have not been cancelled. However, 37% of clients have cancelled their reservations, which has a substantial impact on the hotel's earnings.
2. City hotels experience more bookings compared to resort hotels. This might be because resort hotels are generally more expensive than city hotels.
3. On certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is lower than that of a resort hotel. It is worth noting that resort hotel rates may rise on weekends and holidays.
4. Both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of cancellations peak in August, whereas January has the highest number of cancellations.
5. Cancellations are most common when prices are highest and least common when prices are lowest, indicating that the cost of accommodation is a major factor in cancellations.
6. Portugal is the country with the highest number of reservation cancellations.
7. Approximately 46% of clients book through online travel agencies, while 27% come from group bookings. Only 4% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations.

# Suggestions
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">Cancellation rates increase as prices rise. To prevent reservation cancellations, hotels could adjust their pricing strategies by lowering rates for specific hotels based on location and offering discounts to consumers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">
The ratio of cancellations to non-cancellations is higher for resort hotels compared to city hotels. Therefore, resort hotels should consider offering reasonable discounts on room prices during weekends or holidays.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">In January, hotels can launch campaigns or marketing efforts to increase revenue, as this month sees the highest number of cancellations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-weight: bold;">Additionally, improving the quality of hotels and services, especially in Portugal, can help reduce the cancellation rate.</li>
