*The information is still current and can be used to analyze a hotel's possible plans in an efficient manner.

*There are no unanticipated negatives to the hotel employing any advised technique.

*The hotels are not currently using any of the suggested solutions.

*The biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellations.

*Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked length of time.

*Clients make hotel reservations the same year they make cancellations.
